  abstract = {This paper introduces a copula additive distributional regression framework for mixed count–continuous outcomes, with a focus on simultaneous modelling of the number and cost of physician visits. Traditionally analysed separately, these outcomes are inherently interdependent, and modelling them jointly uncovers relationships that would otherwise be overlooked. The approach employs a zero-truncated count distribution for visit frequency, a continuous skewed distribution with positive support for costs, allows for flexible covariate effects through additive predictors and captures the dependence between the responses using copulae. Alongside model development, model-based statistics, such as conditional expectations, are derived to improve interpretability. Applied to Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, the methodology provides valuable insights into the determinants of visit frequency and healthcare costs, as well as their association, highlighting its potential as a useful tool for decision-makers. To enhance reproducibility and transparency, the modelling framework has been incorporated into the R package GJRM.},

In this article, we describe estimation and interpretation of the effects of a natural experiment using two classes of nonlinear statistical models: one for health care expenditures and the other for counts of health care use. We extend prior analyses to test the effect of the ACA’s young adult expansion on three different outcomes: total health care expenditures, ofﬁcebased visits, and emergency department visits. Modeling the outcomes with a two-part or hurdle model, instead of a single-equation model, reveals that the ACA policy increased the number of ofﬁce-based visits but decreased emergency department visits and overall spending.},

The primary method of estimation for this model is maximum likelihood. This method as well as the generalizations quasi-likelihood and extended quasi-likelihood are discussed. An example using medical expense data from Washington State employees is used to illustrate the methods. The model includes demographic variables as well as an Ambulatory Care Group variable to account for prior health status.}
